A Early prototype version done for itch.io game jam. 
# lastDino
  Around 65.5 million years ago a mass extinction happened in earth which wiped out all the dinosaur lived happily and by luck one small cute dinosaur survived which is still in danger, help poor dinosaur to survive as long as possible from falling meteorite.

This is simple game where you control a dinosaur move left and right to avoid crashing with meteorite.

This game protoype is done in unity, later releases are moved to android studio(libGDX) to reduce APK size.
This current project contains only code of prototype version done in Unity.
We have a seperate private project to maintain actual release code which is based on Android studio.
